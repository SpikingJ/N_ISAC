The N-ISAC paper is implemented using 'snn' package in https://github.com/kclip/snn, which has not been updated for some time and is somewhat challenging to use.
This implementation is based on the 'snntorch' https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, which is easier to implement and see how N-ISAC works.
It offers various hyperparameters to experiment with, which may yield better results and serve as a starting point for further extensions.
